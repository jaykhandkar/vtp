vtp.c - A char device that converts virtual addresses to physical addresses
and prints them to the kernel log buffer when ioctl'd, meant to show how
the linux kernel handles page tables and virtual memory.

vtp_load.sh - A shell script that loads the driver and creates the
corresponding char device /dev/vtp0 using mknod. Build the driver before
running this script.

vtp_unload.sh - Removes the driver from the kernel and deletes the character
device.

page_table_walk.pdf describes in detail how it is done.
